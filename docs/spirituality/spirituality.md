## Science vs. Spirituality
People often ask for more information about spirituality. Coping with Depression and anxiety are not the only reasons. Many people experience a lack of purpose in their lives. Moreover, further investigation of science results in more spiritual concepts being accepted.

> For example, dharma (duty or responsibility) was discovered by the ancient spiritual leaders of Ayurveda. Today, science has found that developing a competing interest is one of the most effective ways of overcoming addictions.

However, that does not mean that spiritual concepts are correct. Some spiritual concepts are backed by evidence and some are not. Also, science is still young in certain aspects such as psychology and neuroscience, so we should not turn away from spiritual concepts completely when looking for truth. Instead, be skeptical and find scientific evidence to support the truth.

> For example, meditation is has a lot of spiritual context, but it is backed by overwhelming science as well.
