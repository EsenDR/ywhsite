## Rise of Mental Illness

In the last 7 years, the suicide rate under the age of 18 has increased by 50%. Mental health has surpassed cancer and cardiovascular disease in the US as the #1 contributor to morbidity and mortality. The number of casualties from military conflict in the last decade is less than the number of men that take their own lives in one year. The primary problem we face today is not physical; it's mental.

:::caution Why is that? Isn’t the world getting better? Aren’t we advancing as a society?
In some ways, but the challenges we face nowadays have changed.

Mental health is getting worse, and our society's response to that is psychiatric treatment. So if you have a mental illness then you should go see a psychiatrist or therapist and they will help you with that. But part of the problem is that somewhere along the way, mental stress became illness.

An illness is when your body or brain does what it is not supposed to. It is a malfunction of your mind or brain. Sometimes depression can be caused by a malfunction. Sometimes, when people feel lost, depressed, stuck, it is not actually a malfunction. It is not like their life is going wonderfully and something in their brain tells them that they are awful human beings. That is what real clinical illness looks like.

If you take a person with schizophrenia might believe that the devil is possessing the people around them. There is not a whole lot of evidence for that, but that is what they believe. Their mind is not congruent with reality.
:::

The challenge we face nowadays is that a lot of our depression is congruent with reality. Especially if you look at Gen Z and millennials — the world that we live in and the reality that we face is actually depressing. If you’re 23 years old and struggling to find a job and feel alone and don’t know what to do with yourself and don’t know where to go, how to put your life together, how to find motivation, then that’s not an illness. Your brain isn’t malfunctioning, that is just life.

Then you have a generation of people who get told, “Oh, you are mentally ill, so go see a psychiatrist or therapist.” So you do that, the psychiatrist or therapist diagnoses you with depression, they start you on a pill, and you go home and play video games all day, browse youtube, scroll through Reddit, etc. The pill doesn’t fix your life, because that is not what it does.

So the first issue is that mental health is getting worse and psychiatrists and therapists aren’t cutting it. The average age of a psychiatrist is older than 50 years old. If you talk to them about Twitch, social media, Reddit, etc, they are not going to understand what you are talking about.

The second thing is that sometimes it can take months to see a psychiatrist or therapist. It can also be quite expensive. Therapists will cost anywhere between $100-$400 per session. Psychiatrists will charge anywhere between $200 for a 30-minute appointment up to $400 or $500, at least in the United States.

### Are Antidepressants Effective?
Some studies published in very reputable journals show that antidepressants are not as effective as we think. A paper published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association) found that antidepressant medication had a small effect size (d = 0.2 on the Cohen Effect Size scale).

That means that antidepressants performed marginally better than placebo, and even this small difference could be due to sampling errors, biases, or chance. Moreover, antidepressants show a smaller effect size for depression rated as mild, moderate, or severe on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). But if it gets rated as very severe, they show a higher efficacy. Another study reports similar results.

One reason for this is that when people see a psychiatrist, not all of them are mentally ill. The pill works if you have a neurochemistry imbalance, but many people have a depression that fits their lives. They are not mentally ill; they are sad because their life is going nowhere.

A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 94% of the trials published showed a positive outcome for the efficacy of antidepressants. However, if we include data from studies that were not published, only 51% of the published studies showed a positive outcome. A separate meta-analysis of the FDA and journal data sets showed that effect sizes ranged from 11 to 69%, with an average of 32% overall efficacy. That indicates a heavy publication bias as only studies with favorable outcomes were published. Another study backs up up the efficacy of antidepressants and publication bias for the same.

### Difference between a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and a Mental Therapist
Mental health professionals have a particular “fit.” The best approach is to visit several mental health professionals and continue to work with the one you like the most.

You do not need to have a massive problem in order to see a therapist. You can go to a therapist to narrow down your problems or when you feel stuck. This will then lead to making healthier decisions to address those problems. Therapy is wonderful and most people should at least get a mental health evaluation.

## Helping a Friend Struggling With Mental Health
As a friend, you are not responsible for someone else’s mental health. You are not a therapist. Support from friends is not a substitute for therapy and medication from a therapist. Be supportive by being a good friend but do not think that you can replace professional help.

The most common reason that prevents suicidal people from killing themselves is having people in their life that matter to them. The therapist should not the one to be telling their patient that they love them. Therapy does not give you a sense of love. You should be the one that should be telling your friend that you love them.

### Being Patient
When helping people, you have to be patient with yourself and other people. Meet people where they are at. It is easy to be upset, but being upset is not what needs to be done. Whether you are at your best or your worst, don’t give up.

:::tip
Do not expect people to be what they are not when you are helping them. Help is not conditional on whether the person is who you expect them to be. You can be productive if you stick with it and accept them for who they are.
:::

It is not about never giving up or being perseverant. It is about being patient, especially with yourself.

:::caution
When you are not at your best, you tend to treat yourself badly, give up on yourself, you call yourself names, and you beat yourself up. Do not do this. Helping yourself can be productive if you give yourself a chance and you stick things through.
:::

People have certain internal beliefs and when the external world sends them a message relating to that belief, it affects them deeply. If your depression worsens from hearing that someone has died, then you might have a belief that the world is a hopeless place.

:::info
Depression is like PTSD — certain things can trigger it to come out, or worsen. If you are running to use the restroom and you have to wait for the stalls, then your desire to go becomes stronger. You might have a view about the world which shapes your attitudes toward events that occur in the world.
