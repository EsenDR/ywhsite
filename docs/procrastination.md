## What Is Procrastination?
Too often, people's ability to think of the future gets out of control. This is called procrastination, because people put off tasks for later in the future, rather than starting now.

Even though people want to do something, wanting to do it is not enough to get them to start doing it. That is why one should do not “try” to do something. You just do it, whether you succeed or fail. Failure is fine because confidence does not come from success. Confidence comes from failing and knowing that you survived the failure.

The problem with trying is that it is in the middle of doing and failing. That prevents you from The hardest step is not the first step, it is the next step.

Procrastination is a solution, not a problem. It is waiting until the last minute to complete a task. As a result, it is an incredibly efficient task completion strategy in terms of value and efficiency (yield/effort).

Procrastination is hard to change or fix because it is so efficient. It is hard to convince our brain that not procrastinating is logical. It is so efficient that a majority of people procrastinate. Moreover, since there are multiple types of procrastination, we tend to misdiagnose and mistreating it.

## Identifying the Type of Procrastination
First, we need to diagnose what kind of procrastination we are suffering from:

The three types are:

### Idealistic Procrastination
1. Fantasy (I want this task to...). You want the situation to be perfectly conducive to success.
2. Readiness: "I will do it when I am ready"

> For example, you'd rather take a 100% chance of an F than a 20% chance at an A.

### Avoidant Procrastination
* It tends to be based on emotions, especially negative emotion.

> "I don't want to do it because it will make me look or feel _______"

Your brain tries to protect you from emotions. To do that, it provides rational justification for why we should not procrastinate. Thinking logically is not effective because the root of procrastination is our emotions.

### Operational Procrastination
It is caused by our brain having difficulty engaging in unclear tasks. When you do a task and you think: "That was not that bad, I could have done that earlier", then it's likely that you were suffering from operational procrastination. Our brain struggles to execute abstract tasks, such as "finding a job".

> "Finding a job" is abstract because the word does not describe the complexity of the steps involved to perform the task.

:::tip
All of these kinds of procrastination can coexist and you may have to deal with two or all of them at the same time.

## Finding a Solution to Procrastination
### Idealistic Procrastination
1. Recognize that you are chasing a fantasy.
2. Grieve your loss (accept it and move forward).
3. Aim low (set low expectations)
4. Let go of your fantasy (Unattainable goal).

### Avoidant Procrastination
1. Recognize the emotions — "What is the emotion that I'm feeling or trying to avoid feeling?"
    > Bad, lazy stupid, incompetent are not emotions  
    > For people that struggle with feeling their emotions: "what is the consequence I'm trying to avoid? How would someone who is in that situation feel?"
2. Work on an emotional level — ask yourself: "If I had a friend who felt X emotion, what would I say to them?" Then say that to yourself (don't be a judge, be a coach).

### Operational Procrastination
1. Sit down with a piece of paper and chunk the task down into its smallest constituent tasks.
2. Start at the end and work to the beginning.
    * Accept offer
        * Receive offer
        * Follow-up post interview notes
        * Interview
            * Dry clean suit
            * Cut hair
    * Apply
        * Meet qualifications
    * Find a job to apply
    * What are my chances to get a job?

It's harder to jump from "I need to find a job" to the interview because you can get knocked down and feel like you have to start from the bottom again. Chunking ensures that when you get knocked down you are back to the applying stage or somewhere in the middle.

## How Intelligence Affects Procrastination
One of the biggest problems that people face is moving into the real world and doing things outside of what they love. As crazy as it sounds, that's a perfectly reasonable problem to have.

Why is it that you guys may have things that you want to do but have trouble doing? You have hopes, you have desires, you have dreams. You even know what you should be doing, but you have trouble doing it. The way to get control of that and control your behavior is to understand where that problem comes from. To understand how to fix something we have to understand what's wrong. A lot of the paralysis that people experience in doing things outside of a what they love comes from the way they were treated when they were very young.

### Being a Smart Kid: Advantage or Disadvantage?
> If a child thinks that they are smart, then they would want to do things that other people are gonna perceive as being smart. But if there are things that they are not very good at, and they feel stupid when they try it, then they are very unlikely to attempt it.

Over time, the smart kid only does things that make them appear smart, which means things that are generally easier. They stay away from things that are hard for them. This works out fine until they reach third grade, fourth grade, or fifth grade because as a smart kid you do not have to spend a whole lot of time studying. You can just do the things that you want to and everyone, including your parents, teachers, family and family friends are all going to say, “Oh, look at that kid, he's so bright.” But over time, those kinds of kids start to avoid challenging things because whenever they do something challenging, they feel stupid. This conflicts with their identity of being smart.

A kid who is told that they are smart avoids challenging things and as they get older, that avoidance becomes baked in. It becomes a part of who they are and how they move around in the world.

This avoidance starts at a very young age. Moreover, the hardest things for people to do are those where you're being observed by other people. You feel incompetent, why is it that that bothers you so much even if those are people that you don't care about? Even if you're never going to see them again.

It's really hard for you to do anything where other people see how incompetent you are. People run away from any sort of experience that makes them feel less than smart or where they feel kind of silly or incompetent. That is paralyzing because everyone is bad at most things in life when they are new to it.

The first way to get around this problem is by reframing a little bit. In the world, we tend to value intelligence and we say, for example, “I went to Yale.” When people learn that the first thing that they say is, “You must be so smart.”

:::tip
The world values, as well as rewards, is experience and competence. A lot of people are really smart, but they don't amount to much.
:::

:::caution
That is probably the way that you feel right now. You feel that despite being so smart, you're not able to accomplish a lot in life. 95 percent of people say that it's because they are lazy. Let's reframe from smart or stupid to experienced and inexperienced.
:::

Your success has nothing to do with your intelligence. It has to do with your experience or inexperience and the degree of your competence. Think about what you want to do and try to reframe in your mind, that it's not that you are smart or stupid — you are experienced or inexperienced.

> For example, you can say, "I suck at interviews.” But actually, interviews require practice, and the more you practice at interviewing the better you are gonna be.

If you're feeling paralyzed in life, or feeling like you can't move out into the world and do the things that you want to do or should do, first look at yourself and ask yourself, “Am I facing this roadblock because I feel judged or stupid?” If the answer to that question is yes, then the first solution that you can try is to make a change in your mindset.

Don't think of yourself as stupid, think of yourself as inexperienced. The neat thing about that is that the more you think of yourself as inexperienced, the more you naturally realize that the solution to inexperience is to try things.

:::tip
When you try things and you accept that you are inexperienced, then failure becomes more and more acceptable. The problem that you have likely is that you cannot tolerate the idea of failing.
:::

If you can reframe to inexperience then failure becomes a normal part of it. You have to learn, you have to stumble a couple of times before you learn how to walk. If you can make that shift then that is a good first step to you being able to move forward in the world and overcome that obstacle of feeling like you're stupid or feeling like you're judged.
